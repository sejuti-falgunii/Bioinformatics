Medulloblastoma is a rare, fast-growing childhood brain cancer that originates in the cerebellum, can spread to other parts of th brain, often spreading through cerebrospinal fluid. It is often hereditarily conditioned[1]. Although medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor among children worldwide the overall incidence of this disease is low (0.49 per 100 000 children per year44)[2]. Combined multimodality approaches, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, have improved the outcome of medulloblastoma. Advances in genomic research have shown that medulloblastoma is not a biologically or clinically discrete entity, which means its not a single entity, but has many forms. Previously, the risk was divided according to histology (microscopic appearance of the tumor cells which helps pathologists determine the specific type of medulloblastoma, which helps predict how the tumor will behave and respond to specific treatment. Different types of medulloblastoma have different characteristics and may require different treatment approaches.), presence of metastasis (the spread of cancer cells from the original tumor site to other parts of the body, whether the tumor has spread to other areas within the brain or spinal cord. The presence or absence of metastasis is a crucial factor in determining the stage of the cancer and planning treatment.), degree of resection (This refers to how much of the tumor is surgically removed;
Complete resection: Ideally, surgeons aim to remove the entire tumor.
Partial resection: Sometimes, due to the tumor's location or its involvement with critical brain structures, only part of it can be safely removed.
Gross total resection: This means the surgeon believes they have removed all visible tumor, but some microscopic cells may remain.), and age at diagnosis.
Through the development of integrated genomics, new biology-based risk stratification methods (using information about the tumor's genes to figure out how likely it is to grow quickly, spread, and respond to treatment. It helps doctors classify patients into different risk groups (low, medium, high) so they can tailor treatment accordingly. It approached to more personalized treatment, reduce the side effects of treatment, and improve the outcome-the survival rate & quality of life) have recently been proposed.[3] The work here is designed to screen novel and significant biomarkers, which may perform as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in MB.
